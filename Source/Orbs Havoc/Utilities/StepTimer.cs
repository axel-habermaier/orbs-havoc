	///   Provides time measurements and raises the update event whenever necessary. In variable
	///   timestep mode, the update event is raised as often as possible, i.e., once with every call to
	///   Update(). In fixed timestep mode, the timer attempts to raise the update event approximately at
	///   intervals of the given target elapsed time. Therefore, if the application is calling Update() faster
	///   than the target elapsed time, not every call to Update() raises the update event. On the other hand,
	///   if calls to Update() are infrequent, the update event might be raised several times to catch up.
	///   However, MaxDelta limits the maximum elapsed time between two calls to Update(), as unreasonably long
	///   pauses are usually due to the app being inactive for some time or due to the debugger pausing the app.
